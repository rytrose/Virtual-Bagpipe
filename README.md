# Virtual-Bagpipe
**FOR GRADER**
The important files are the Max patch (`assignment_2/Assignment_2.maxpat`), the Arduino sketch (`assignment_2/assignment_2.ino`), and the Three.js html file (`assignment_2/visuals/web/index.html`).

The Three.js was a modified example, and all of the stuff I injected is either in the OSC code/handlers and in the `render()` function.
